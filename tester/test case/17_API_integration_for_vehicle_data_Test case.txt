Epic name: Vehicle Data Management
Feature name: API integration for vehicle data
Feature id: 5.2

Test Case 1
Test Case Name: Retrieve vehicle data successfully
Test Description: Verify that the system can retrieve vehicle data including make, model, year, and price through the API.
Precondition: API is up and running
Test Steps:
- Send a GET request to the API endpoint for fetching vehicle data
- Verify that the response contains make, model, year, and price information
Expected result: The API response should include all the required vehicle data fields.

Test Case 2
Test Case Name: API documentation verification
Test Description: Check if the API documentation is well-documented and easy to understand for integration.
Precondition: API documentation is available
Test Steps:
- Review the API documentation for clarity and completeness
- Check if the documentation includes sample requests and responses
Expected result: The API documentation should be clear, comprehensive, and include examples for easy integration.

Test Case 3
Test Case Name: Efficient handling of API requests
Test Description: Ensure that the system can handle API requests efficiently and provide timely responses.
Precondition: System is under normal load
Test Steps:
- Send multiple concurrent API requests for fetching vehicle data
- Measure the response time for each request
Expected result: The system should respond to API requests within an acceptable time frame even under load.

Test Case 4
Test Case Name: Invalid API endpoint
Test Description: Verify the system behavior when an invalid API endpoint is used for fetching vehicle data.
Precondition: API endpoint is incorrect
Test Steps:
- Send a GET request to a non-existent API endpoint
Expected result: The system should return a proper error response indicating the endpoint is not found.

Test Case 5
Test Case Name: Missing parameters in API request
Test Description: Check how the system handles API requests with missing parameters for fetching vehicle data.
Precondition: Required parameters are omitted in the request
Test Steps:
- Send a GET request without specifying all the required parameters
Expected result: The system should return a clear error message indicating the missing parameters.

Test Case 6
Test Case Name: Boundary testing for API response size
Test Description: Test the system's ability to handle large API responses for vehicle data.
Precondition: System is under normal load
Test Steps:
- Send a request that would result in a large response size
Expected result: The system should be able to handle and return the large response without performance degradation.

Test Case 7
Test Case Name: API rate limiting
Test Description: Validate the system's rate limiting mechanism for API requests.
Precondition: API rate limiting is configured
Test Steps:
- Send multiple API requests exceeding the rate limit
Expected result: The system should enforce rate limiting and return appropriate error responses when the limit is exceeded.

Test Case 8
Test Case Name: API security verification
Test Description: Ensure that the API integration for vehicle data follows security best practices.
Precondition: API security measures are in place
Test Steps:
- Perform security testing using tools like OWASP ZAP
Expected result: The API should be secure and not vulnerable to common security threats.

Test Case 9
Test Case Name: API response format validation
Test Description: Check if the API response format for vehicle data is consistent and follows a predefined structure.
Precondition: API response is received
Test Steps:
- Validate the response format against the expected schema
Expected result: The API response should adhere to the defined structure and data types.

Test Case 10
Test Case Name: API versioning support
Test Description: Verify that the system supports API versioning for future updates and backward compatibility.
Precondition: API versioning is implemented
Test Steps:
- Test API requests with different version headers
Expected result: The system should respond with the appropriate version of the API response based on the version header provided.
