Based on the provided test cases focusing on key scenarios that cover positive flow only, the regression test cases can be identified as follows:

Regression Test Case 1:
Test Case Name: AI decision support availability
Test Description: Verify that the system still provides AI-powered decision support for the warranty product field after a system update.
Precondition: User is logged into the system.
Test Steps:
- User navigates to the warranty product field.
- User checks for the presence of AI-powered decision support.
Expected result: AI-powered decision support is still available for the warranty product field post-update.

Regression Test Case 2:
Test Case Name: Data fields consideration
Test Description: Ensure that the AI-powered decision support still considers all relevant data fields provided by the user after a system update.
Precondition: Relevant data fields are populated by the user.
Test Steps:
- User inputs relevant data fields for the warranty product.
- User requests decision support.
Expected result: AI-powered decision support still considers all provided data fields in the decision-making process post-update.

These regression test cases focus on critical functionalities related to AI decision support availability and data fields consideration, ensuring that these key features continue to work as expected even after system updates or changes.
