Based on the provided test cases focusing on positive scenarios, the regression test cases can be identified as follows:

Regression Test Case 1:
Test Case Name: AI feature generation based on provided data fields
Test Description: Verify that the system can generate AI-enabled features based on the provided data fields.
Precondition: Data fields for warranty product are available.
Test Steps:
- Provide input data fields for warranty product.
- Trigger the AI feature generation process.
- Check the generated AI-enabled features.
Expected result: AI-enabled features are successfully generated based on the provided data fields.

Regression Test Case 2:
Test Case Name: Accuracy of AI-enabled features
Test Description: Ensure that the AI-enabled features generated are accurate and relevant to the warranty product field.
Precondition: AI feature generation process has been completed.
Test Steps:
- Review the generated AI-enabled features.
- Verify the relevance of the features to the warranty product field.
Expected result: The AI-enabled features are accurate and relevant to the warranty product field.

These two regression test cases cover key functionalities related to AI feature generation and accuracy, which are critical for the overall functionality of the system.
