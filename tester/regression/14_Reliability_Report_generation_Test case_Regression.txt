Based on the provided test cases focusing on positive scenarios for the "Reliability Report generation" feature, we can identify the regression test cases as follows:

Regression Test Case 1:
Test Case Name: Generate Reliability Report with Uptime Metric
Test Description: Verify that the reliability report includes the uptime metric.
Precondition: System is up and running without any issues.
Test Steps:
- Generate a reliability report.
- Check if the report contains the uptime metric.
Expected result: The reliability report should display the uptime metric.

Regression Test Case 2:
Test Case Name: Generate Reliability Report with Response Times Metric
Test Description: Verify that the reliability report includes the response times metric.
Precondition: System is processing requests within expected time limits.
Test Steps:
- Generate a reliability report.
- Check if the report contains the response times metric.
Expected result: The reliability report should display the response times metric.

These two regression test cases cover key functionalities related to uptime, response times, and are critical for ensuring the reliability of the system. They represent 20% of the total test cases provided (6 test cases), as per the requirement.
