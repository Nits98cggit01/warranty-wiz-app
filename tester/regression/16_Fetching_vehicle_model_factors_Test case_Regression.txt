Based on the provided test cases focusing on positive scenarios, the regression test cases can be identified as follows:

Regression Test Case 1:
Test Description: Verify that the system provides a list of available vehicle models with their corresponding factors.
Precondition: System is up and running with vehicle model data available.
Test Steps:
- Access the system to fetch the list of available vehicle models.
- Check if the list includes make, model, year, and price for each vehicle model.
Expected result: The system displays a comprehensive list of vehicle models with all required factors.

Regression Test Case 2:
Test Description: Verify that the user can filter and search for specific vehicle models based on different criteria.
Precondition: System is up and running with vehicle model data available.
Test Steps:
- Use the search functionality to filter vehicle models based on make, model, year, or price.
- Verify that the search results match the specified criteria.
Expected result: The system allows the user to accurately filter and search for specific vehicle models.

These two regression test cases cover key functionalities related to fetching and filtering vehicle model factors, which are crucial for the overall functionality of the feature.
