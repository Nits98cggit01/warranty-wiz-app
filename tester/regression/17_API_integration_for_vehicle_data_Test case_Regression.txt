Based on the provided test cases, the regression test cases focusing on key scenarios covering positive flow only can be identified as follows:

Regression Test Case 1:
Test Case Name: Retrieve vehicle data successfully
Test Description: Verify that the system can retrieve vehicle data including make, model, year, and price through the API.
Precondition: API is up and running
Test Steps:
- Send a GET request to the API endpoint for fetching vehicle data
- Verify that the response contains make, model, year, and price information
Expected result: The API response should include all the required vehicle data fields.

Regression Test Case 2:
Test Case Name: API documentation verification
Test Description: Check if the API documentation is well-documented and easy to understand for integration.
Precondition: API documentation is available
Test Steps:
- Review the API documentation for clarity and completeness
- Check if the documentation includes sample requests and responses
Expected result: The API documentation should be clear, comprehensive, and include examples for easy integration.

These two regression test cases cover essential functionalities related to retrieving vehicle data successfully and verifying the clarity of API documentation, which are critical for the positive flow of the system. These regression test cases represent 20% of the total test cases provided.
