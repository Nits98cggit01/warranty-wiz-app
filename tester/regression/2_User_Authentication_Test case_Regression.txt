Based on the provided test cases focusing on positive scenarios, the regression test cases can be identified as follows:

Regression Test Case 1:
Test Description: Verify successful authentication with valid credentials
Precondition: User is on the login page
Test Steps:
- Enter valid username and password
- Click on the "Login" button
Expected result: User should be authenticated successfully

Regression Test Case 2:
Test Description: Verify authentication failure with invalid credentials
Precondition: User is on the login page
Test Steps:
- Enter invalid username and password
- Click on the "Login" button
Expected result: User should not be authenticated and should see an error message

These two regression test cases cover key scenarios related to successful authentication with valid credentials and authentication failure with invalid credentials, which are critical functionalities for user authentication. These cases ensure that the basic authentication functionality remains intact after any changes or updates in the system.
