To automate the regression test cases using BDD framework with Java and Selenium, we can use Cucumber for writing feature files and step definitions. Below is an example implementation for the provided regression test cases:

1. Create a feature file for the regression test cases:

RegressionTestCases.feature
```gherkin
Feature: User Role Access Control

  Scenario: Admin Access - All Functionalities
    Given User is logged in as an Admin
    When User navigates to each functionality
    Then User should have access to all functionalities

  Scenario: Role-Based Access Control Enforcement
    Given Users with different roles are registered in the system
    When Different roles are assigned to users
    Then System should enforce role-based access control
```

2. Create step definitions for the feature file:

RegressionTestSteps.java
```java
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;
import io.cucumber.java.en.When;

public class RegressionTestSteps {

    @Given("User is logged in as an Admin")
    public void userIsLoggedInAsAdmin() {
        // Implement login as Admin
    }

    @When("User navigates to each functionality")
    public void userNavigatesToEachFunctionality() {
        // Implement navigation to each functionality
    }

    @Then("User should have access to all functionalities")
    public void userShouldHaveAccessToAllFunctionalities() {
        // Implement verification of access for each functionality
    }

    @Given("Users with different roles are registered in the system")
    public void usersWithDifferentRolesAreRegistered() {
        // Implement user registration with different roles
    }

    @When("Different roles are assigned to users")
    public void differentRolesAreAssignedToUsers() {
        // Implement assigning different roles to users
    }

    @Then("System should enforce role-based access control")
    public void systemShouldEnforceRoleBasedAccessControl() {
        // Implement verification of role-based access control enforcement
    }
}
```

3. Create a TestRunner class to execute the feature file:

TestRunner.java
```java
import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(features = "src/test/resources/RegressionTestCases.feature",
                 glue = "stepDefinitions")
public class TestRunner {
}
```

4. Implement the automation scripts using Java and Selenium WebDriver to interact with the application and perform the test steps as defined in the step definitions.

This setup allows you to execute the regression test cases using the BDD framework with Cucumber, Java, and Selenium. You can enhance the step definitions with Selenium actions to interact with the application and validate the expected results.
