To automate the regression test cases using a BDD framework with Java and Selenium, we can use Cucumber for writing feature files and step definitions. Below is an example implementation for the provided regression test cases:

1. Create a feature file for Regression Test Case 1:

```gherkin
Feature: Verify the list of available vehicle models

Scenario: Verify the system provides a list of available vehicle models with their corresponding factors
  Given the system is up and running with vehicle model data available
  When I access the system to fetch the list of available vehicle models
  Then the list should include make, model, year, and price for each vehicle model
```

2. Create a feature file for Regression Test Case 2:

```gherkin
Feature: Verify the user can filter and search for specific vehicle models

Scenario: Verify the user can filter and search for specific vehicle models based on different criteria
  Given the system is up and running with vehicle model data available
  When I filter vehicle models based on "<criteria>"
  Then the search results should match the specified criteria
```

3. Create step definitions for the feature files:

```java
public class VehicleModelSteps {

    @Given("the system is up and running with vehicle model data available")
    public void systemIsUpAndRunning() {
        // Implementation to set up the system
    }

    @When("I access the system to fetch the list of available vehicle models")
    public void fetchListOfVehicleModels() {
        // Implementation to fetch the list of vehicle models
    }

    @Then("the list should include make, model, year, and price for each vehicle model")
    public void verifyVehicleModelFactors() {
        // Implementation to verify the factors of each vehicle model
    }

    @When("I filter vehicle models based on {string}")
    public void filterVehicleModels(String criteria) {
        // Implementation to filter vehicle models based on the specified criteria
    }

    @Then("the search results should match the specified criteria")
    public void verifySearchResults() {
        // Implementation to verify the search results
    }
}
```

4. Implement the automation scripts using Java and Selenium WebDriver to interact with the system and perform the test steps defined in the step definitions.

5. Run the Cucumber tests to execute the regression test cases and verify the expected results.

By following this approach, you can automate the regression test cases using a BDD framework with Java and Selenium, ensuring that the key functionalities related to fetching and filtering vehicle model factors are thoroughly tested.
