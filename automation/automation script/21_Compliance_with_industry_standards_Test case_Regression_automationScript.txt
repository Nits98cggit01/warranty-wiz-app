To automate the provided regression test cases using a BDD framework with Java and Selenium, we can use Cucumber for writing feature files and step definitions. Below is an example implementation for the given test cases:

1. Create a feature file for the regression test cases:

RegressionTestCases.feature
```gherkin
Feature: Warranty Coverage Compliance

  Scenario: Validate warranty coverages adherence to industry regulations and standards
    Given Warranty coverage options are available in the system
    When each warranty coverage option is verified against industry regulations and standards
    Then all warranty coverages should adhere to industry regulations and standards

  Scenario: Trigger review of existing warranty coverages for compliance updates
    Given Changes to industry standards are detected
    When a review of existing warranty coverages is triggered for compliance updates
    Then existing warranty coverages should be reviewed and updated for compliance with new industry standards
```

2. Create step definitions for the feature file:

RegressionTestSteps.java
```java
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;
import io.cucumber.java.en.When;

public class RegressionTestSteps {

    @Given("Warranty coverage options are available in the system")
    public void warrantyCoverageOptionsAvailable() {
        // Implementation to verify availability of warranty coverage options
    }

    @When("each warranty coverage option is verified against industry regulations and standards")
    public void verifyWarrantyCoverageCompliance() {
        // Implementation to verify compliance of each warranty coverage
    }

    @Then("all warranty coverages should adhere to industry regulations and standards")
    public void validateWarrantyCoverages() {
        // Implementation to validate adherence of all warranty coverages
    }

    @Given("Changes to industry standards are detected")
    public void changesDetected() {
        // Implementation to detect changes in industry standards
    }

    @When("a review of existing warranty coverages is triggered for compliance updates")
    public void triggerReviewForUpdates() {
        // Implementation to trigger review of existing warranty coverages
    }

    @Then("existing warranty coverages should be reviewed and updated for compliance with new industry standards")
    public void reviewAndUpdateWarrantyCoverages() {
        // Implementation to review and update existing warranty coverages
    }
}
```

3. Create a TestRunner class to execute the feature file:

TestRunner.java
```java
import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(features = "src/test/resources/RegressionTestCases.feature",
                 glue = "stepDefinitions")
public class TestRunner {
}
```

4. Implement the Selenium automation code within the step definitions to interact with the application and perform the necessary verifications.

Make sure to set up your Selenium WebDriver instance and handle the interactions with the application based on the test steps defined in the step definitions.

By following this structure, you can automate the provided regression test cases using a BDD framework with Java and Selenium.
