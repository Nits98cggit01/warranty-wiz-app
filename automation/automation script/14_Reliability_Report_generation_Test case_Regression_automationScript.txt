To automate the regression test cases using BDD framework with Java Selenium, we can use Cucumber for writing feature files and Gherkin syntax to define the scenarios. Below is an example implementation for the provided regression test cases:

1. Create a feature file named `ReliabilityReport.feature`:

```gherkin
Feature: Reliability Report Generation

  Scenario: Generate Reliability Report with Uptime Metric
    Given System is up and running without any issues
    When I generate a reliability report
    Then The report should display the uptime metric

  Scenario: Generate Reliability Report with Response Times Metric
    Given System is processing requests within expected time limits
    When I generate a reliability report
    Then The report should display the response times metric
```

2. Create step definitions for the feature file:

```java
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.When;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;

public class ReliabilityReportSteps {

    @Given("System is up and running without any issues")
    public void systemIsUpAndRunning() {
        // Add code to ensure system is up and running
    }

    @Given("System is processing requests within expected time limits")
    public void systemProcessingRequestsWithinLimits() {
        // Add code to ensure system is processing requests within expected time limits
    }

    @When("I generate a reliability report")
    public void generateReliabilityReport() {
        // Add code to generate reliability report
    }

    @Then("The report should display the uptime metric")
    public void verifyUptimeMetric() {
        // Add code to verify uptime metric in the report
    }

    @Then("The report should display the response times metric")
    public void verifyResponseTimesMetric() {
        // Add code to verify response times metric in the report
    }
}
```

3. Create a Test Runner class to execute the feature file:

```java
import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(features = "src/test/resources/ReliabilityReport.feature",
                 glue = "stepDefinitions")
public class TestRunner {
}
```

4. Implement the Selenium code within the step definitions to interact with the system and verify the metrics in the generated report.

5. Run the Test Runner class to execute the automation scripts for the regression test cases.

This setup will allow you to automate the provided regression test cases using BDD framework with Java Selenium, ensuring the reliability report generation feature is tested for uptime and response times metrics.
