To automate the regression test cases using BDD framework with Java Selenium, we can use Cucumber for writing feature files and Gherkin syntax to define the scenarios. Below is an example implementation of the automation scripts for the provided regression test cases:

1. Create a feature file (e.g., RecordReport.feature) with the following scenarios:

```gherkin
Feature: Record Report Generation

  Scenario: Verify record report includes claimant information, claim details, and resolution status
    Given Claim filed with complete information
    When Generate record report for a filed claim
    Then Verify that the report contains claimant information, claim details, and resolution status

  Scenario: Verify report is generated in a timely manner for claim processing
    Given Claim filed and system operational
    When File a claim
    And Generate record report
    Then Measure the time taken to generate the report
    And Verify report is generated within acceptable time limits
```

2. Create step definitions for the feature file:

```java
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.When;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;

public class RecordReportSteps {

    @Given("Claim filed with complete information")
    public void claimFiledWithCompleteInformation() {
        // Implement claim filing with complete information
    }

    @When("Generate record report for a filed claim")
    public void generateRecordReport() {
        // Implement record report generation
    }

    @Then("Verify that the report contains claimant information, claim details, and resolution status")
    public void verifyReportContents() {
        // Implement verification of report contents
    }

    @Given("Claim filed and system operational")
    public void claimFiledAndSystemOperational() {
        // Implement claim filing and system operational setup
    }

    @When("File a claim")
    public void fileAClaim() {
        // Implement filing a claim
    }

    @Then("Measure the time taken to generate the report")
    public void measureReportGenerationTime() {
        // Implement measuring report generation time
    }

    @Then("Verify report is generated within acceptable time limits")
    public void verifyReportGenerationTime() {
        // Implement verification of report generation time
    }
}
```

3. Create a TestRunner class to run the feature file:

```java
import io.cucumber.junit.Cucumber;
import io.cucumber.junit.CucumberOptions;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;

@RunWith(Cucumber.class)
@CucumberOptions(features = "src/test/resources/RecordReport.feature", glue = "stepDefinitions")
public class TestRunner {
}
```

4. Implement the automation logic for claim filing, report generation, and verification using Java Selenium WebDriver.

This setup will allow you to automate the provided regression test cases using the BDD framework with Java Selenium. You can enhance the step definitions with Selenium actions to interact with the web application and validate the report contents and generation time.
