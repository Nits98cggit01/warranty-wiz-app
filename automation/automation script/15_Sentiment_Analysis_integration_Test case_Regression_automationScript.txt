To automate the provided regression test cases using BDD framework with Java and Selenium, we can use Cucumber for writing feature files and Gherkin syntax to define the test scenarios. Below is an example implementation of the automation scripts for the given regression test cases:

1. Create a feature file for the regression test cases:

```gherkin
Feature: Sentiment Analysis Integration Regression Testing

  Scenario: Real-time processing of customer feedback
    Given Sentiment analysis integration is active
    When a sample customer feedback is sent in real-time
    Then the system should process the feedback instantly without delays

  Scenario: Categorization of feedback
    Given Sentiment analysis integration is active
    When feedback with positive sentiment is submitted
    And feedback with negative sentiment is submitted
    And feedback with neutral sentiment is submitted
    Then the system should correctly categorize the feedback into the respective sentiment categories
```

2. Create step definitions for the feature file:

```java
import io.cucumber.java.en.Given;
import io.cucumber.java.en.When;
import io.cucumber.java.en.Then;

public class SentimentAnalysisSteps {

    @Given("Sentiment analysis integration is active")
    public void sentimentAnalysisIntegrationIsActive() {
        // Implementation to check if sentiment analysis integration is active
    }

    @When("a sample customer feedback is sent in real-time")
    public void sendSampleFeedbackInRealTime() {
        // Implementation to send sample feedback in real-time
    }

    @When("feedback with positive sentiment is submitted")
    public void submitFeedbackWithPositiveSentiment() {
        // Implementation to submit feedback with positive sentiment
    }

    @When("feedback with negative sentiment is submitted")
    public void submitFeedbackWithNegativeSentiment() {
        // Implementation to submit feedback with negative sentiment
    }

    @When("feedback with neutral sentiment is submitted")
    public void submitFeedbackWithNeutralSentiment() {
        // Implementation to submit feedback with neutral sentiment
    }

    @Then("the system should process the feedback instantly without delays")
    public void verifyRealTimeProcessing() {
        // Implementation to verify real-time processing of feedback
    }

    @Then("the system should correctly categorize the feedback into the respective sentiment categories")
    public void verifyFeedbackCategorization() {
        // Implementation to verify feedback categorization
    }
}
```

3. Implement the Selenium WebDriver code within the step definitions to interact with the web application for sending feedback and verifying the results.

This is a basic outline of how you can automate the provided regression test cases using BDD framework with Java and Selenium. You can further enhance the automation scripts by adding more detailed validations and error handling based on your application requirements.
